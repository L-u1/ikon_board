Version 2.1.8 r2
-------------

Due to the recent slew of kiddie-wannabe hackers and the delay in completing iB3 we've released another version of v2.1.8.



What's New?
-----------

Security Fixes in several scripts.



How do I upgrade?
-----------------

If you are currently running v2.1.7, or v2.1.8, simply upload the following files over your current files:

-help.cgi
-setbadwords.cgi
-setmembertitles.cgi
-setvariables.cgi
-setstyles.cgi
-ikon.lib (* Only do this to increment the version number, you may do this by hand on your current ikon.lib if desired)

What Else?
----------

Hopefully the 'strange' date that appears when viewing profiles should be fixed in this version.
Topics now stay closed!

Thanks

The Ikonboard Team
